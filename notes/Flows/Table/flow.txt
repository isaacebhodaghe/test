    1 . Uncoupled Table - similar to sematic table default using react boostrap

        designs

        Perks
            1. gives flexiblity to create anything to users

        Disadvantages
            1. helper function have to be provided on how to handle pagination, sorting, filtering
            and any advance functionality.
            2. leave room for developer to misuse component if so desired

    2. Object formated table - 

        This requies the user to pass in an array of object for containing row and column cnotainging the
        diffrent helper functions

        Perks
            1. Encapsulation and Clean code
            2. Less room for error 
            3. futuer changes are hidden to the users

        Disadvantages
            1. Slight learning curve for component user
            2. might require user to format their object before using component
